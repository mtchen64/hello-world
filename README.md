# hello-world
my first repository

hi github!
this is the first time i'm thinking of really making learnign coding a thing to me. 
i know i am the kind of person that tends to make this become a spur-of-the-moment thing. but ill try to find the true motivation that can help me sustain!
bear with me! see what i can accomplish!
